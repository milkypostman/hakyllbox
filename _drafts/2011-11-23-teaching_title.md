title: Touch your Toes
---

Here are some thoughts and reminders to myself after teaching my first
semester of three classes; Introduction to Computing (non-majors),
Operating Systems, and Computer Networks.  These may be way off and
after trying them next semester I may decide it was all a bunch of BS.
They may also not be agreeable for other people; there is probably
some over-the-counter medicine to help with that.

# Classwork

My initial approach -- due to conventional installment -- was to do
lectures. Let me just say that as a student I hated taking notes --
loved doodling -- and was always bored in lectures. I always thought,
"why should I read the book when this person is going to tell me about
what I read?" And because the lecture material was so general, I was
able to grasp it really easily; I wasn't challenged.

There was no incentive for me to care about lectures
insofar as to get the initial information about what was due when and
get some sleep. It's not right by any means; I was a bad student. I
learned it in high school. I can remember the *first* day that I fell
asleep in class; I finally felt normal! For so many years I was always
awake -- mostly paying attention -- and then one fine day in Biology
class, sophomore or junior year [^hazy], I put my head down and slept
for a good 10 minutes. It prepared me for college; I could stay up
late programming and watching A-Team re-runs, and then catch up on
sleep in class.

[^hazy]: the date is hazy but I remember where I was sitting: middle
row, about 3/4 of the way to the back

So I think back now and wonder if I failed as a student or if I am
failing now. I don't want to completely badmouth lectures. There is
time for lectures for sure. If the entire class is having trouble
grasping a concept, it makes sense to have a discussion that focuses
around the instructor talking at a board.  But I don't buy the idea
that I should stand up and rattle off basic concepts that (i) students
already understand because they read about it before class or
(ii) students will not learn because there is no way to get all the
important information from any lecture.

## Group Work

One of the things I love the most in my college work was group
projects.  Not because I could slack off, but because we would have
group meetings where we could discuss ideas and thoughts about
problems.
