title: The Rug is not the Issue
---

In an attempt to collect and process all my thoughts from my first
semester teaching I started to write them out. Instead of just pushing
them into some directory, I've decided to expand them publicly for *some number*
of reasons like: (i) I'm forced to really think about what I'm
saying, believe it, and possibly back it up with anecdotal evidence,
(ii) I need to revise, (iii) I can get feedback from others,
hopefully not my boss with a pink slip, and (iv) it may be useful to
others.

*Expectations* are weird. Everyone has at least one expectation of
other people -- I expect you will not come out of a dark corner and
stab me because you like my coffee mug -- but many times they go
unsaid. The important distinction to make is that *expectations* and
*responsibilities* are two different things.

To me an expectation is just something that one or more persons
expects to happen; *I expect that the Sun will rise tomorrow.* Does that
mean an expectation will always happen? Probably, but it may not. I
expect my cell phone will work anywhere I go, but sometimes that
doesn't happen.

On the other hand, a responsibility is something that one or more
persons has control over and is, in some way, accountable for. I am
responsible for whether or not I jump out of a dark corner and stab
someone for their coffee mug -- love coffee mugs. I have control over
my jumping and stabbing, I am accountable for taking that action if
I decide to do it. And sure, as a society we mostly agree about this
*expectation*,
that's why there is a law about stab jumping. But that's irrelevant
really -- well, maybe a law is a socially agreed upon expectation; I'm
not a sociologist though.

Interestingly, even though our expectations may change, like if we
move to New York or Chicago, responsibilities don't.

So maybe a responsibility and an expectation are unrelated. But as far
as the professor-student relationship goes, I have expectations of my
students -- carefully chosen to try and set goals which, if
accomplished, should result in an increase in knowledge or ability --
and the students are responsible for reaching those expectations or
not. Similarly, the student has some level of expectation of the
professor to facilitate the learning experience -- lecturing,
providing problems, answering questions -- and the professor is
responsible for meeting those expectations or not. And the best I can
come up with is that each party is only responsible for the things
they can control in order to meet an expectation.

There are two reasons that expectations cannot be met: they are
impossible to meet, commonly known as *unreasonable expectations*, or
they are unknown. It seems there is an unspoken *college* contract
that students and professors enter into, but there isn't always
clearly defined *expectations*. So what I have tried to do is to
outline what I think are general expectations I have of students and
the expectations that I have of professors (myself).

Being Bong.


# Expectations for Students

It's hard to jump into teaching, have expectations for students, and
not *explicitly* know or express what those expectations are; students
inevitably fail to meet these expectations. Thinking about this now makes me
feel like a fool; how could I have been so foolish? But it's not
obvious. This is probably one of the biggest problems with people in
general; we set expectations for other people, they don't know we have
those expectations or the expectations are not well-defined, they fail
to meet those expectations, and then we blame them. In my first
semester I knew what I expected, but I didn't know how to express it;
so I have been fairly lenient. However, I feel like I now have a
better sense of what those expectations are.  Get ready...


## [RTFM]

[RTFM]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM

You can [ask all the questions](#ask-questions) you want but at some
point you have to start thinking about how to answer your own
questions. In some ways professors are a crutch. It's a lame
statement: your professor won't be there forever, your
[boss at your job][baddays] is paying you to be the question answerer.
So as a student, know that sometimes the answer is that you need to
look it up.

[baddays]: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7daZK2gPDQM

There are numerous times that I am looking over a student's shoulder
at their code and I ask what the purpose of a particular line is.
It's OK for the student to not know the answer. It's *not* OK for the
student to _not_ go look it up. Students should have a knee-jerk
reaction: switch to a browser and [search][lmgtfy] or switch to a
terminal and RTF[`man`][man].

I have experienced many situations where a student just *guesses* at
something. My response is to look it up if I don't know something,
possibly out of habit from years of asking questions on IRC and
getting yelled at. Looking up an answer saves everyone time.

[man]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page
[lmgtfy]: http://lmgtfy.com/

Surely, it's not always a fix. If you go and look things up, find some
semblance of an answer, and still don't understand something, then
it's OK to call in the talent.

## Ask Questions

Being a student means being interested in *something* and wanting to
learn about it because you need to solve a problem or answer a
question. Learning means acquiring knowledge about *something*. And I
truly believe the only way you can *really* learn about something is
to dig in and resolve any questions you might have about that
*something*.

So there are two ways to think about asking questions: you should
definitely always ask questions. If you know a topic perfectly, then
it's your responsibility to yourself to ask a question and see what
someone else thinks about it -- and then correct them when they're
wrong. If you don't know the material then you should have lots of
questions. If you don't have questions you're not thinking about it
hard enough.

For example: I am not even a Sun *novice*, but I can come up with plenty
of questions: What kind of firepower would it take to blow up the sun?
Would earth be destroyed as a result?

Unfortunately, there aren't *dumb* questions. There are just *better*
questions. If you're talking about microwaves, it's not a dumb
question but it doesn't make sense to ask, "how do I make ice cubes
with a microwave?" Better questions to ask would be, "what does a
microwave do?" or "how long do I set the time so my popcorn doesn't
burn?" Popcorn has to be one of the biggest obstacles in microwave
design.

If you're a student reading this and don't buy my explanation: do it
just to suck up to your professor. Also, be selfish. A student I was
talking to about this, who claimed to ask questions all the time, made
a good point: you're paying for your time in class with a so-called
*expert*, why not get your moneys worth by asking questions you want
answers for?


## Give **an** answer

> *The enemy of the good is the perfect.*

I guess this is from [La Bégueule][] by [Voltaire][], but I will always
attribute it to a friend of mine.  This helped push me from my OCD
of spending inordinate amounts of times trying to make things perfect.
It also keeps me from tweaking my [Emacs config][dotemacs] and
[dot files][dotfiles] too much.  But it applies nicely to asking
questions: *the enemy of a good answer is the perfect one.*

One thing that annoys me as a professor -- right or wrong -- is students
not taking the risk on an answer, especially when the student knows
the answer! Students need to remember we're all really stupid about
lots of things. Hell, I'm the professor and half the stuff we do in
the class I... er... never mind. Basically, as much as I don't want to
be, I'm wrong all the time; sometimes that's my responsibility (see
[Be Wrong](#be-wrong)). The only other thing that annoys me --
slightly less -- is when students answer in a soft voice. And the only
reason this annoys me is because too many years bashing cymbals next
to a Fender Twin Reverb has destroyed my ears.

Take it from any band instructor who will tell you: if you're going to
screw up, screw up like you meant it, with confidence!

## Don't take it personally

If you get an answer wrong, don't take it personally if the professor
tells you it's not a good answer to the question.  It's really not
personal.  Use your frustration -- from either *having* to answer the
question or getting it wrong -- to motivate yourself to understand how
you could've possibly gotten that answer wrong.  Then learn the
material better than the professor and do the following,


## Prove the professor wrong

It's the professors responsibility to [be wrong](#be-wrong).  So make it easy on
them and challenge them, [question them](#ask-questions).


## Be Responsible

The number one thing a student should demonstrate is that they deserve
the right to vote in an election of the United States president; *be
responsible*.  I am a very irresponsible person -- I know that it's
not the most fun thing in the world -- and I manage by putting
reminders in my phone and calendar for everything that I have to do,
along with poorly maintaining my own hack of [GTD] management.  It has
been semi-successful.  Regardless, it sucks to have to be responsible
but you have to do it because otherwise you're bothering other people.
Plus you're really making things harder than they need to be.  I
believe if Facebook had a calendar feature much of this could be
alleviated.

[GTD]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done

Students are not alone. It is important to remember *both* the
professor and the student need to be responsible in the learning
experience. Responsibility is not about blame, it's about
acknowledging control over the situation. And really there are so many
resources available (Google, libraries, classmates, professors,
tutors, etc.) that it's easy to be responsible. It's just a matter of
actually *being* responsible that is the hard part. The challenge is
figure out what way of being responsible works for you. Maybe you
don't like talking to the professor but Google works, then no
problemo, use Google. If that *doesn't* work, then you have to try
other means.

And hey, sometimes being responsible means talking to the professor
about *their* expectations of the students.

## Self Evaluate

I think that in most cases the students I've had are pretty accurate
in their evaluations of their performance. Surprising to me is that
students don't complain about really low grades on assignments,
projects, or exams. The ones that tend to question the grading tend to
be students that already have an A but want a better A -- probably the
reason they have an A to begin with -- so remember to
[ask questions](#ask-questions).

What is more interesting though is that students tended to
over-estimated their ability before a test. Yet, after the test, most
didn't really feel unjustified in the way the test was graded.  And
most of the points weren't taken off because of problems remembering
facts, but from not thinking things through or having a
conceptualization of the material.  Possibly this was caused by
students having their *first* exam with me and not knowing what to
expect.  Only the final exam will tell.

Throughout the semester it's probably a good idea to stop and think --
I know its hard -- about how you are doing.  It doesn't hurt to go in
and ask the instructor either.  Students should remember that
assignments are really just the professor evaluating the student from
their point of view.  In fact, the professor could be wrong; many times
they are.  But a student should take that information and consider
*why* they were evaluated in that way. This should lead to insight
into how the student can next time self-evaluate their work.  If only
students came pre-built with the habit of self-evaluating their
assignment and then revising.  But in most cases we know that students
work on homework the night before it's due -- likely an hour before
it's due -- meaning their is no time for evaluation.

The whole thing of evaluation is painful, but like writing, as you
do it more you do it, the more likely you'll get it right the first
time in the future and not need as much revising.  It gets easier and
becomes natural.

## Be the professor

I'd say **think critically** but it's more than that.

I have always felt I became the best student of a topic when I had to
teach that topic. Knowing you have to explain *something* to
someone else, and possibly field unexpected questions, gives you an
added incentive to think critically about it. Group work attempts
some form of this, hoping all students will *teach* the other students
at some point or another. However, this seems to only partially work
in practice; strong--brain strong, not muscle strong--students become
*more* reinforced in the material, and weaker
students increase knowledge but don't catch up to the stronger
students, and don't get to take the on the *professor* role.
But *all* students should take on the professor role.

I can confirm that I became a better student after being a teaching assistant;
I felt so guilty for turning in some of the crap I did as an
undergraduate.

# Expectations of the Professor

Compiled here are the self-expectations, of myself, based on ad hoc
questions strategically placed in assignments to serve as periodic
evaluations of my behavior, discussions with various students,
discussions with other faculty, and my [brain]. I anxiously await
"official" student evaluation forms as I know they are going to be a
riot. Seriously, I cannot wait. But for now these will have to
suffice.

[brain]: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RijB8wnJCN0&ob=av3e


## Don't be a professor

Professors should really be expected to be *model students*. Professor
is a poor term; they should be called *scholars* in the archaic
sense: *a student*.

## [RTFM]

The same business applies for professors.  Be engaged in the topic.
If the professor isn't interested in the topic -- especially when
students propose fascinating questions that should be answered for the
sake of humanity -- then how can the students be?

This also covers the expectation that professors be *somewhat enthusiastic*.


## Be Wrong

Sometimes you should be wrong.  It does two things: makes you look
human -- you are -- and demonstrates recovery from mistakes.  It's not
hypocritical to be wrong about something, it's hypocritical to not own
up to those mistakes.

This is a hard thing to accept. I have personally never had a problem
with this as my biggest problem is believing I've been
[proven wrong](#prove-the-professor-wrong).


## Timing

The biggest downfall I had my first semester was that my timing was a
hot mess.

I took things way too slow, at least in the beginning. There are lots
of reasons that I did this and part was fear of running out of
material. The other was thinking that I needed to discuss all the
details. What I have realized is that it's really the student's
responsibility -- that dreaded word -- to [read](#rtfm) and
[learn](#ask-questions) about the details, and the responsibility of
the professor is to [facilitate] the acquisition of knowledge by
students; help them understand the important details when they don't.

[facilitate]: http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/facilitate

Another thing I am going to try is to pace the class based on the best
students. Students that perform badly are likely being held back due
to their lack of self-motivation, not their lack of intelligence. I
noticed this year that no matter how much time I gave students to
complete a project, most students would wait until the last minute
anyways; except for the few good students who put time in gradually. I
guess my suggestion -- to myself? -- is to quickly hone in on these
students, follow their progress, and learn the pace for the class;
likely they are going to get the work completed without too much
stress and they can more accurately suggest the *right* time needed to
complete the assignment. Also I will call these students "flatliners".
If I don't have a *flatliner* I guess I'll just give them all a lot of
work all the time. If it's due the next day they can't really
procrastinate...


## Provide Environments

On advice of various people, next year I am going to try an provide
different environments for students to participate;

1. In class
2. On discussion forums
3. In small groups


## Organize

This semester I winged it -- wung it? what's the past-tense of wing?
-- and it turned out a bit like
[spaghetti code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code). Sure,
it accomplished the goal, but it's not something I'll turn to in order
to guide the class again. At the same time it feels like a necessary
evil. Figure out how to climb a mountain by climbing a mountain.

Sure, I shouldn't sit around all day planning and not getting anything
done, but next time I teach need to plan out the semester more
thoroughly. I still haven't decided if I could have done more detailed
planning for the first semester -- likely I could have -- but I did
learn a lot by leaving it somewhat open.

Mostly I learned about
[pacing](#speed-up) and how quickly material can be digested. This has
given me a sense of how I can distribute the material temporally
throughout the semester.   One thing I grossly
underestimated was the time required by students to do various
[classwork](#classwork). Although some of that is needing to push the
students more, especially at the beginning of the semester.

Still, *remember to organize*.


## Let Learning Dictate Structure

I now believe it's more important that students gain skills in
learning as opposed to trying to cover a particular box of material.
As professors we should use the material as a tool to teach learning.
If students can learn they can learn the material later.

What I have also found is that in certain subjects -- like Computer
Science (CS) -- there are many repeated *themes*.  For instance, in
Operating Systems we learn about the problem of synchronizing a cache
for a processor. This same type of issue with syncing appears when we
talk about multiprocessor systems.  For non-CS people, think about
learning coordination for riding a bicycle; it's the same problem as
riding a motorcycle even though they are different machines.  OK,
maybe not the best example but I'm sure you can find an example from
any discipline.  The same theme is all over the Computer Networks area
but I'll spare the details.

Regardless, figure out what you want to instill in the students over
the course of the semester and let that dictate the structure of the
class; how you present the material.
