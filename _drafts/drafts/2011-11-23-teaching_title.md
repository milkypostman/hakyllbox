title: Touch your Toes
---

Here are some thoughts and reminders to myself after teaching my first
semester of three classes; Introduction to Computing (non-majors),
Operating Systems, and Computer Networks.  These may be way off and
after trying them next semester I may decide it was all a bunch of BS.
They may also not be agreeable for other people; there is probably
some over-the-counter medicine to help with that.

# Timing

The biggest downfall I had this semester was that my timing was hot
 mess. I winged it [^wingit] and it turned out a bit like
 [spaghetti code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code). Sure,
 my teaching plan accomplished the goal in a messy way; it's not
 something I'll turn to in order to teach the class again. In general
 this is the theme here right?

## Organize

Sure, I shouldn't sit around all day planning and not getting anything
done, but next time I teach need to plan out the semester more
thoroughly. I don't want to make excuses and say that I couldn't have
done this for *this* semester, because I could have, but I do want to
say that I learned a lot of the experience. Mostly I learned about
[pacing](#speed-up) and it gives me a better sense -- looking at the
material before hand -- how quickly it will be digested.  It also has
given me a sense of how long it will take students to do
[classwork](#classwork), which I definitely did not anticipate
correctly.

Still, *remember to organize*.

[^wingit]: (wung it?  what's the past-tense of wing?)

## Speed Up!

I took things way too slow. There are lots of reasons that I believe
this and part was fear of running out of material. The other was
thinking that I needed to discuss all the details. What I have
realized is that it's really the student's responsibility to
[read](#rtfm) and learn about the details, and more my responsibility
to facilitate the knowledge they attempt to acquire; help them
understand the details when they don't.

## Let Timing Dictate Structure

I now believe it's more important that students gain skills in
learning as opposed to trying to cover a particular box of material.
As teachers we should use the material as a tool to teach learning.
If students can learn they can learn the material later.

What I have also found is that in certain subjects -- like Computer
Science (CS) -- there are many repeated *themes*.  For instance, in
Operating Systems we learn about the problem of synchronizing a cache
for a processor. This same type of issue with syncing appears when we
talk about multiprocessor systems.  For non-CS people, think about
learning coordination for riding a bicycle; it's the same problem as
riding a motorcycle even though they are different machines.  OK,
maybe not the best example but I'm sure you can find an example from
any discipline.  The same theme is all over the Computer Networks area
but I'll spare the details.

Regardless, figure out what you want to instill in the students over
the course of the semester and let that dictate the structure of the
class; how you present the material.


# Classwork

My initial approach -- due to conventional installment -- was to do
lectures. Let me just say that as a student I hated taking notes --
loved doodling -- and was always bored in lectures. I always thought,
"why should I read the book when this person is going to tell me about
what I read?" And because the lecture material was so general, I was
able to grasp it really easily; I wasn't challenged.

There was no incentive for me to care about lectures
insofar as to get the initial information about what was due when and
get some sleep. It's not right by any means; I was a bad student. I
learned it in high school. I can remember the *first* day that I fell
asleep in class; I finally felt normal! For so many years I was always
awake -- mostly paying attention -- and then one fine day in Biology
class, sophomore or junior year [^hazy], I put my head down and slept
for a good 10 minutes. It prepared me for college; I could stay up
late programming and watching A-Team re-runs, and then catch up on
sleep in class.

[^hazy]: the date is hazy but I remember where I was sitting: middle
row, about 3/4 of the way to the back

So I think back now and wonder if I failed as a student or if I am
failing now. I don't want to completely badmouth lectures. There is
time for lectures for sure. If the entire class is having trouble
grasping a concept, it makes sense to have a discussion that focuses
around the instructor talking at a board.  But I don't buy the idea
that I should stand up and rattle off basic concepts that (i) students
already understand because they read about it before class or
(ii) students will not learn because there is no way to get all the
important information from any lecture.

## Group Work

One of the things I love the most in my college work was group
projects.  Not because I could slack off, but because we would have
group meetings where we could discuss ideas and thoughts about
problems.
