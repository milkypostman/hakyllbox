title: The Rug is not the Issue : Responsibilities
---
In an attempt to collect and process all my thoughts from my first
semester teaching I started to write them out. Instead of just pushing
them into some directory, I've decided to post them for *some number*
of reasons like: (i) it means I really need to think about what I'm
saying, believe it, and possibly back it up with anecdotal evidence,
(ii) I need to revise, (iii) it means I can get feedback from others,
hopefully not my boss with a pink slip, and (iv) it may be useful to
others.

I have lots of thoughts, we all do, and my initial idea was to put
them all into one giant file and let people trudge through it. But I
am now about 1/4 of the way through and I decided it will probably be
too cumbersome by the time I am done; lets do installments (or as we
say in networks: *segments*).

The first section I wrote up, which may be the most important, is
about expectations. We all have at least one expectation of 
other people -- I expect you will not come out of a dark corner and stab me
because you like my coffee mug -- but many times they go unsaid. The
important distinction to make is that *expectations* and
*responsibilities* are two different things. 

To me an expectation is just something that one or more persons
expects to happen; I expect that the Sun will rise tomorrow. Does that
mean an expectation will always happen? Probably, but may not. I
expect my cell phone will work anywhere I go but sometimes that
doesn't happen.

On the other hand, a responsibility is something that one or more
persons has control over is in some way accountable for. I am
responsible for whether or not I jump out of a dark corner and stab
someone for their coffee mug (love coffee mugs). I have control over
my jumping and stabbing I am accountable for taking that action if
decide to do it. And sure, most people expect that out of each other,
that's why there is a law about stab jumping, but that's irrelevant really.

Interestingly, even though our expectations may change, like if we
move to New York or Chicago, the responsibility doesn't.

So maybe a responsibility and an expectation are unrelated. But as far
as the professor-student relationship goes, I have expectations of my
students -- carefully chosen to try and set goals which, if
accomplished, should result in an increase in knowledge or ability --
and the students are responsible for reaching those expectations or
not. Similarly, the student has some level of expectation of the
professor to facilitate the learning experience -- lecturing,
providing problems, answering questions -- and the professor is
responsible for meeting those expectations or not. And the best I can
come up with is that each party is only responsible for the things
they can control in order to reach an expectation.

There are two reasons that expectations cannot be met: they are
impossible to meet, commonly known as *unreasonable expectations*, or
they are unknown. It seems there is an unspoken *college* contract
that students and professors enter in to, but there isn't always
clearly defined *expectations*. So what I have tried to do is to
outline what I think are general expectations I have of students and
the expectations that I have of professors (myself).

# Expectations for Students

It's hard to jump into teaching, have expectations for students, not
*know* explicitly what those expectations are, and then have the
students do them.  This is probably one of the biggest problems with
people in general; we set expectations for other people, they don't
know we have those expectations, they fail to meet those expectations,
and then we blame them.  In my first semester I expect that I haven't
made these explicit and so I have been fairly lenient.   However, I
feel like now I have a better sense of what those expectaitons are and
I wanted to outline them.

## [RTFM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM)

Do your work.  You can ask all the questions you want but at some
point you have to start thinking about how to answer them yourself.
Your teacher won't be there forever and your boss at your job is
paying you for this.  So as a student, expect that the answer is
sometimes that you need to look it up.  Sometimes you simply don't
have enough current knowledge to answer the question you want
answered.  

There are numerous times that I am looking through code for a student
and I ask what an argument is doing. It's OK for the student to not
know the answer; it's *not* OK for the student to not switch to a
browser or another terminal and search for the function or lookup the
`man` page. Most of the time I'd have to go look it up also. But the
problem is normally that I would've went and looked it up before using
it -- out of habit from years of asking questions on IRC -- and the
student will just guess and then when it doesn't work ask the
instructor.

If you go and look things up, find some semblance of an answer, and
then don't understand it, then it's time to bring in the real firepower.

## Ask Questions

Being a student means being interested in
*something* and wanting to learn about it.  Learning means acquiring
knowledge about *something*. And I truly believe the only way you can
*really* learn about something is to dig in and resolve any questions
you might have about that *something*.

So there are two ways to think about this; you should always ask
questions. If you (the student) know the material perfectly, then it's
your responsibility to yourself to ask a question and see what someone
else thinks about it -- and then correct them when they're wrong. If
you don't know the material then you should have lots of questions. If
you don't have questions you're not thinking about it hard enough.

I am not a Sun expert. What kind of firepower would it take to blow up
the sun? Would earth be destroyed as a result?

If you're a student reading this and don't buy my explanation: do it
just to suck up to your teacher.


## Give **an** answer

Sure, there is *always a better way* of doing things.  Even when we
think we have found the best way there is probably always a better
way.  Just because we don't know about a better way right now doesn't
mean that it doesn't exist.  How can you say that?

> *The enemy of the good is the perfect.*  

I guess this is from [La Bégueule][] by [Voltaire][] but I will always
attribute it to a friend I have.  This helped to push me from my OCD
of spending inordinate amounts of times trying to make things perfect.
It also keeps me from tweaking my [Emacs config][emacsconfig] and
[dot files][dotfiles] too much.

The one thing that annoys me the most as a teacher is students being
*afraid* to answer a question or take the risk on an answer;
especially when the student knows the answer! Students need to
remember we're all really stupid about something. Hell, I'm the
teacher and half the stuff we do in the class I have to refresh my
memory on (except for facts about the Sun). Plus, as much as I don't
want to be, I'm wrong all the time. In fact, sometimes that my
responsibility (see [Be Wrong](#be-wrong).  The only other thing that annoys
me -- slightly less -- is when students answer in a soft voice.
And the only reason this annoys me is because I spent too many years
playing loud rock and roll music and can't hear.

Any band instructor and they will tell you: if you're going to screw
 up, screw up like you meant it; with confidence!

## Prove the teacher wrong

It's the teachers responsibility to [be wrong](#be-wrong).  So make it easy on
them and challenge them, [question them](#ask-questions).

## Be responsible

The number one thing a student should demonstrate is that they deserve
the right to vote in an election of the United States president; *be
responsible*.  I am a very irresponsible person -- I know that it's
not the most fun thing in the world -- and I manage by putting
reminders in my phone and calendar for everything that I have to do,
along with poorly maintaining my own hack of GTD management.  It has
been semi-successful.  Regardless, it sucks to have to be responsible
but you have to do it because otherwise you're bothering other people.
Plus you're really making things harder than they need to be.  I
believe if Facebook had a calendar feature much of this could be
alleviated.  That gives me an idea!

Students are not alone. It is important to remember *both* the
professor and the student need to be responsible in the learning
experience. Responsibility is not about blame, it's about
acknowledging control over the situation. And really there are so many
resources available (Google, libraries, classmates, professors,
tutors, etc.) that it's easy to be responsible. It's just a matter of
actually *being* responsible that is the hard part. The challenge is
figure out what way of being responsible works for you. Maybe you
don't like talking to the professor but Google works, then no
problemo, use Google. If that *doesn't* work, then you have to try
other means.

And hey, sometimes being responsible means talking to the professor
about *their* expectations of the students.


## Self Evaluate

I think that in most cases the students I've had are pretty accurate
in their evaluations of their performance. Surprising to me is that
students don't complain about really low grades on assignments,
projects, or exams.  The ones that tend to question the grading tend
to be students that already have an A but want a better A; probably
the reason they have an A to begin with[^1].

What is more interesting though is that students tended to
over-estimated their ability before a test. Yet, after the test, most
didn't really feel unjustified in the way the test was graded.  And
most of the points weren't taken off because of problems remembering
facts, but from not thinking things through or having a
conceptualization of the material.  Possibly this was caused by
students having their *first* exam with me and not knowing what to
expect.  Only the final exam will tell.

Throughout the semester it's probably a good idea to stop and think --
I know its hard -- about how you are doing.  It doesn't hurt to go in
and ask the instructor either.  Students should remember that
assignments are really just the teacher evaluating the student from
their point of view.  In fact, the teacher could be wrong; many times
they are.  But a student should take that information and consider
*why* they were evaluated in that way. This should lead to insight
into how the student can next time self-evaluate their work.  If only
students came pre-built with the habit of self-evaluating their
assignment and then revising.  But in most cases we know that students
work on homework the night before it's due -- likely an hour before
it's due -- meaning their is no time for evaluation.  

The whole thing of evaluation is painful, but like writing, as you
do it more you do it, the more likely you'll get it right the first
time in the future and not need as much revising.  It gets easier and
becomes natural.
