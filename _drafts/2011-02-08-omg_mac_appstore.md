The Mac AppStore was introduced exactly one month ago and I am already
exhausted.  Migration is the biggest pain in the world.

It's obvious that any new app developer is going to write exclusively for the
AppStore and try to avoid having to manage all the business of selling and
verifying licenses for their application.  At the same time there is this mush
of apps that have two versions of their app to support both pre-existing
customers and new customers.  But this isn't just a strain on the companies,
it's a strain on power-users.

Through no fault of the developers, an app that gives me headache when thinking
about the AppStore is [Divvy](http://mizage.com/divvy/).
[Mizage](http://mizage.com/) did a great thing by allowing users who had
purchased Divvy in the last 60 days the opportunity to buy the AppStore
version, submit their receipt to the company, and receive a refund for their
original purchase.  I applaud them.  Even though I originally managed to get a
discounted version of Divvy using some random coupon, I wanted to consolidate
all my apps to use the AppStore so I went ahead and took their offer.  The
idiot I am I figured that having all updates in a single place would increase
my overall day to day experience.  Today Mizage released a beta version of
Divvy so that people could test a new feature.  Unfortunately AppStore users
are shit out of luck because the new version only accepts old license keys.
Luckily my old license still works.  I like beta software

A week ago I decided that even though I like
[Launchbar](http://www.obdev.at/launchbar) I would give
[Alfred](alfredapp.com/) a go.  Alfred has gained a lot of popularity
due to exposure in the AppStore but the free version *in* the AppStore is
little more than a glorified application launch, not much else going on there.
No, for my purposes I needed
to use Alfred in [POWER PACK](http://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/) style.
Well, through a number of exchanges with Alfred's kind support staff
I found that there wasn't a way to get the Power Pack without using the version
posted on the website.  So, I wrote back saying that I would just wait for
in-app purchases to come to the AppStore and buy it then.  Apparently the Alfred
team did not want me to wait!  The kind support staff suggested that I actually
download the website version because it would give me immediate access to the
power-pack AND in the future I would get access to exclusive beta versions!  I
LOVE BETA VERSIONS!!! HOW COULD I RESIST??!?  So I bought it on the website.
They probably also should've mentioned that they get a better cut of the cost
(all of it) when I buy through their website.

I guess I have to wonder about the usefulness of the AppStore for my own
personal use.  Conceptually I love the AppStore.  It only reinforces my
belief in promoting Apple products and trusting that anyone who switches to a
Mac will have an excellent experience.  But I am one of those from the *"switched from
linux to apple because there is a terminal builtin"* crew and I truly do love
my bleeding edge developments.  In my day you had to compile your own apps and
fix bugs before you could use them.  So running beta software doesn't piss me
off to the extent that it might with a normal user.  I enjoy submitting bug
reports.  I like contributing to making things better.  It's definitely not a
lifestyle for everyone.  At the same time, I don't want to put added stress on
developers.  My impression is that managing both an AppStore version and a
separate version is a pain.  And for new app developers, it doesn't make sense
to develop for the AppStore *and* create their own checkout system and manage
their own licenses.  In fact that's the whole point of the AppStore.
