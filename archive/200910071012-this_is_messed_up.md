There are some classic lines:

Guy: "You're not an American!"
Host: ".... I AM an American?"

Anyways, it's worth watching and only 7 minutes long. I need to watch ABC primetime more often. Dateline always had that crazy pedo stuff on. It's hard to believe people are OK with this. I am so sheltered.

This just made me think about if I've ever let this kinda thing happen without saying anything. The only thing I can remember is that I was at Wacky Waters (waterpark just outside the Quad Cities) when I was real young and I met this guy and his brother that I hung out with all day. We went to play miniature golf and there were these guys behind us that kept hitting their ball up while we were still on the hole! Except, we started to notice that they only did it to the guy's brother, who happened to have some developmental disability, but they would NOT do it when either I or my friend were putting. His brother would make a comment back at the guys and they would just laugh at him. I got pissed for the 10 year old or whatever I was. Finally they hit their ball up on him, I stepped up on the it and hit the goddamn thing out of the park. Pain Stewart style! Of course I got kicked out of the miniature golf course but it was worth it. The guy running it was just some punk teenager who should've seen what was happening but was too busy looking at girls or something. Those guys were pricks. I think that's the closest I ever got to standing up for someone else that was being picked on for something they couldn't change.

If you don't say anything you're just as bad as the people that say something negative. Letting people think it's OK to do shitty things doesn't help anyone. Luckily I live in a town where I don't encounter that much.
