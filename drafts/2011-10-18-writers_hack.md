title: Writer's Hack
---

Last night I stayed up until 3am messing with this site. Right now
it's generated using static [Markdown] files using [Hakyll] relying on
[Pandoc]. This is good for me and there are enough other people to
have argued the merits of this that I don't need to.

But if you look down this page you can see I don't post that much.

I am now starting to believe that much of the reason for wanting to
hack on this site was simply to play around more with [Haskell]. I
have slowing been trying to write my own static site generator using
Haskell -- one that mimics the behavior of [Jekyll] -- but have also
felt that I needed to be writing. Of course this is a major
undertaking as it requires not only parsing some small header
information from each markdown file but also writing a template engine
-- or using a pre-existing one where the property looks barren. So
what is it? How should I spend my time?

There is a mixup in my brain.  I am motivating myself to learn Haskell
by building a blog.  So much so that I have convinced myself that I
will be writing to this blog consistently.  Maybe I will; Probably I
won't.  Except, in the mixup of writing all this Haskell code, the
"practical" side of me -- leftover from graduate school -- is telling
me that I should stop *playing* with Haskell and start writing.  But
then that kinda defeats the whole purpose of writing this blog to
begin with.

I think this is like the *productivity gurus* who are constantly
playing around and tweaking their workflow. They could ultimately keep
*tweaking* things and never actually use those tweaks for workflow
improvement. That's the nice thing about that job; tweaking is really
the job. But they still need to write these things up and so where
should someone draw the line. In my case it's clear that I *do* need a
website to jot things down and publicly expose things that I think
others might like, but I don't know what that means. I also think that
there may be other projects where I could use Haskell and this may not
be the one to spend my time on. On the other hand, maybe it is perfect
as Haskell has an amazing language parser in Parsec and [Pandoc] is
amazing.

Right now I am out of my element.
