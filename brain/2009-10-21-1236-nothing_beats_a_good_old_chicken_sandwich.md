As I sat here waiting for some code to finish running, I started
thinking about how good my lunch is going to be, and yet, how simple
it is... (in revision I realized how my tenses in this sentence are
all over the place)

First a side comment about brown bagging it.  Tara and I went to visit
my aunt recently and she mentioned how all these girls where she works
are always complaining about how they don't have money and all this,
yet they go out to eat everyday.  Her direct quote was "HAVEN'T YA
HEARD OF BROWN BAGGIN' IT?"

So that has been a true inspiration to me.  Only eat lunch out once a
week and the Airliner has half-off Tuesdays so you can get a large
deep dish pizza for like 10 bucks.  It's enough for four people.  I
went yesterday and we had so much left over that I took it down to the
ped-mall and gave it to some guy that held a sign saying "anything
helps."  The thing that pissed me off though was that the guy was
pulling out a pack of beef jerky from his bag.  I guess deep dish
pizza is better than jerky but still, he at least had enough money to
buy jerky.  That stuff is expensive!

Anyways, long story short, the trick to brown bagging is preparation.
You have to think in advance and try to prep some of the stuff for
later.  Monday I bought about four chicken breasts and cooked them on
the George Foreman grill.  So this morning I heated up a breast,
slathered some mayo on some bread, and I'm pretty sure this is going
to be one excellent sandwich.
