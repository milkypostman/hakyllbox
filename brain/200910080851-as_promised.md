Recall the first <a href="http://milkbox.net/2009/10/notes-i-found-today/" target="_blank">note i found the other day.</a> Well, I saw this big black truck pull up in our lot as I was leaving and I saw the guy so I decided I'd talk to him "as promised." So he didn't seem too bad. I think he's had lots of notes called on him. There is one on a door downstairs (I think it's probably his door) that says something to the effect of "if there are loud noises coming from the apt, come talk to me before you call the police." Which, I GET!

So yeah, he didn't seem like that bad of a guy and all is well. I told him it's just hard to get out of spots and kinda annoying so avoiding parking there would be nice. He got a note on his truck which in all honesty was kind of the person. I have wanted to tow people who park there. Hell, it may have been from the apartment people. I'll try to click a picture of the note on his door. It's pretty great.
