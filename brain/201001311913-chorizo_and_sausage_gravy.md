## Ingredients

- 1lb sausage
- 1 stick of chorizo
- 2 eggs
- flour
- milk

## Process

- Cook the sausage and chorizo.
- Leave the grease in the pan.
- Add four _very_ rounded tablespoons of flour[^flour]. Maybe more.
- Cook the meat and flour mixture a bit.
- Slowly add milk and mix until you get theconsistencyyou want.
- Mix in the two eggs and let that cook.

[^flour]: the more flour you add the more gravy you're going to get. I
like mine on the meatier side and for 1lb of sausage four rounded
tablespoons was good.

You're on your own for biscuits. I would suggest something better than
Grands, they always have a bad aftertaste to me. I admit, there's not
much too it but I've never seen biscuits and gravy with chorizo in
it. I have tried just chorizo in the gravy but it's just not as
good. Here is a picture. Don't let the lookdeceiveyou.

Most likely I will make this better by adding Bacon.
