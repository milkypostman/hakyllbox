<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
\t<li>1lb sausage</li>
\t<li>1 stick of chorizo</li>
\t<li>2 eggs</li>
\t<li>flour</li>
\t<li>milk</li>
</ul>
<h3>Process</h3>
<ol>
\t<li>Cook the sausage and chorizo.</li>
\t<li>Leave the grease in the pan.</li>
\t<li>Add four <span style="text-decoration: underline;">very</span> rounded tablespoons of flour<sup>*</sup>. Maybe more.</li>
\t<li>Cook the meat and flour mixture a bit.</li>
\t<li>Slowly add milk and mix until you get theconsistencyyou want.</li>
\t<li>Mix in the two eggs and let that cook.</li>
</ol>
<sup>*</sup><em>the more flour you add the more gravy you're going to get. I like mine on the meatier side and for 1lb of sausage four rounded tablespoons was good.</em>

You're on your own for biscuits. I would suggest something better than Grands, they always have a bad aftertaste to me. I admit, there's not much too it but I've never seen biscuits and gravy with chorizo in it. I have tried just chorizo in the gravy but it's just not as good. Here is a picture. Don't let the lookdeceiveyou.

Most likely I will make this better by adding Bacon.
