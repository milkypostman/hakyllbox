I am in the midst of making my first recipe...

<h3>Chunky Corn Chowder Recipe</h3>
<ul>
\t<li>1/2 pound bacon, diced</li>
\t<li>4 Tbsp butter</li>
\t<li>2 large yellow onions, diced</li>
\t<li>1 red pepper, seeded and diced</li>
\t<li>2 tsp thyme, ground</li>
\t<li>1 tsp cumin, ground</li>
\t<li>1/4 tsp turmeric, optional for color</li>
\t<li>2 pounds white potatoes, washed, skins on and cubed</li>
\t<li>6 cups chicken stock, homemade, chicken base with water, or 4-6 bouillon cubes with water to taste</li>
\t<li>6 Tbsp cornstarch</li>
\t<li>6 Tbsp cold water</li>
\t<li>2 cups heavy cream or half and half</li>
\t<li>4 cups corn kernels, fresh, frozen or canned and drained</li>
\t<li>1/2 tsp fresh black pepper, ground</li>
</ul>
<h3>Directions:</h3>
<ol>
\t<li>In large stockpot, fry bacon until cooked and crispy but not burned. Drain fat, reserving 2 Tbsp, and place bacon on paper towel to cool. Set aside.</li>
\t<li>Add butter to the reserved fat and cook onions, and peppers until crisp-tender.</li>
\t<li>Add the spices, potatoes and chicken stock. Cook on low until potatoes are almost cooked through.</li>
\t<li>In small glass, dissolve cornstarch in cold water.</li>
\t<li>Add mixture to hot soup a little at a time stirring constantly. This will thicken up very quickly. Keep stirring.</li>
\t<li>On low heat, add cream or half and half or milk to the chowder and stir. Simmer for 10-15 minutes until hot. Do not bring to a boil.</li>
\t<li>Add corn and black pepper, stir and remove from heat.</li>
</ol>

First off, I cut up four pounds of potatoes instead of the 2 that it tells me to.  All that means is we have breakfast potatoes for tomorrow.  Right now the potatoes are getting simmered until they're almost cooked through.  Although it says to cook on Low, I don't think that's right, cause the chicken stock was barely going.

I'm also not sure when i'm supposed to re-add the bacon in.  I'm going to just do it when I add the corn.  The fact that this recipe has bacon in it is just a coincidence.  I saw "chunky" before I saw that it had bacon in it.

I think that Tara and I are going to just freeze this and then have it for lunches.  I should probably be monitoring it more closely.  I forgot to let the milk simmer for 15 min before adding the corn.  But I ended up adding more corn than specified (it is corn chowder after all) so maybe that'll make up for it.  Although, the corn might get mushy.

Whatever.  I'll eat it.

And....  Done
