If it helps the name at all, give it a french accent.

I got the hankering to make some cookies and now I'm nauseous from cookie dough. I'm also sugar high or just super tired. Here we go.
<ul>
<li>1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter (room temperature)</li>
<li>3/4 cup granulated white sugar</li>
<li>3/4 cup firmly packed light brown sugar</li>
<li>2 large eggs</li>
<li>1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
<li>2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
<li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1 cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
<li>1 cup toffee chips</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Cream the 1 cup (2 sticks) of butter with a mixer.</li>
<li>Add 3/4 cup white sugar and 3/4 cup brown sugar and get that all mixed.</li>
<li>Beat in 2 eggs one at a time.</li>
<li>Add 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla.</li>
<li>In a separate bowl, mix 2 1/4 cups flour, 1 teaspoon baking soda, 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
<li>Collide the flour mixture and the butter mixture.</li>
<li>Mix in 1 cup chocolate chips and 1 cup toffee chips.</li>
<li>You have two options:
<li>Put parchment paper on a cookie sheet.</li>
<li>Put mounds of cookie dough on the parchment paper.</li>
<li>375 degrees for about 10-12 minutes.</li>
</ol>
This made a ton of cookies and I'm pretty sure all my sampling of
cookie dough reduced the amount of cookies I madeby at least 2-3.  The
original recipe says 12-14 minutes and I think it was a little too
long.  My first batch charred a bit but also my oven sucks.  It's so
small I cannot fit a normal sized cookie sheet in so I had to use a
bunch of small ones.  The parchment paper is a gift.  Less cleanup and
nothing sticks to it.  So awesome.
