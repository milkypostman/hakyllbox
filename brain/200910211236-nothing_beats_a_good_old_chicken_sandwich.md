As I sat here waiting for some code to finish running,  I started thinking about how good my lunch is going to be, and yet, how simple it is... (in revision I realized how my tenses in this sentence are all over the place)

First a side comment about brown bagging it.  Tara and I went to visit my aunt recently and she mentioned how all these girls where she works are always complaining about how they don't have money and all this, yet they go out to eat everyday.  Her direct quote was "HAVEN'T YA HEARD OF BROWN BAGGIN' IT?"

So that has been a true inspiration to me.  Only eat lunch out once a week and the Airliner has half-off Tuesdays so you can get a large deep dish pizza for like 10 bucks.  It's enough for four people.  I went yesterday and we had so much left over that I took it down to the ped-mall and gave it to some guy that held a sign saying "anything helps."  The thing that pissed me off though was that the guy was pulling out a pack of beef jerky from his bag.  I guess deep dish pizza is better than jerky but still, he at least had enough money to buy jerky.  That stuff is expensive!

Anyways, long story short, the trick to brown bagging is preparation.  You have to think in advance and try to prep some of the stuff for later.  Monday I bought about four chicken breasts and cooked them on the George Foreman grill.  So this morning I heated up a breast, slathered some mayo on some bread, and I'm pretty sure this is going to be one excellent sandwich.
