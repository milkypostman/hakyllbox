Man!  I don't know how they come up with this stuff!  If you haven't
been watching House you should rent the old episodes and catch up.  I
admit it's kinda repeat from episode-to-episode but there is always
something random happening and you're like "OH MAN THIS IS GONNA BE
GREAT!"  You know something is coming but you don't know what!  That
is the best.
