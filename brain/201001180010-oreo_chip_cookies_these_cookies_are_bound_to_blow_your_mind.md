I was hesitant to post this amazing recipe for cookies but I guess I'm never going to be able to sell it or get any money for it. So here goes:
<h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>
<ul>
\t<li>2 1/4 cups flour</li>
\t<li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
\t<li>1 tsp salt</li>
\t<li>1 cup (2 sticks) butter</li>
\t<li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
\t<li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
\t<li>2 large eggs</li>
\t<li>2 cups crushed Oreos</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Directions</strong></h3>
<ol>
\t<li>Oven to 375.</li>
\t<li>Mix 2 1/4 cups flour, 1tsp baking soda, 1tsp salt in a bowl.</li>
\t<li>In a separate bowl (optional), beat the hell out of 2 sticks of butter, 3/4cup of granulated sugar, 1tsp of vanilla extract, and 2 eggs.</li>
\t<li>Gradually beat in the flour mix.</li>
\t<li>Put in the Oreos and then make some balls on a cookie sheet and cook 9-12 minutes.</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Notes</strong></h3>
To be honest, this is the NESTLE TOLLHOUSE recipe for chocolate chip cookies. But these are Oreo Chip Cookies, so you don't use chocolate chips. If you ever forget, it's also 50 other places on the web. Also, they say to mix the flour and all that separate and slowly add but the first time I did this I just mixed everything in a bowl and it was fine.

If you're not really an Oreo person, you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">could</span> substitute something else but you'd be wrong in doing so. Oreo Chip is really the best choice. A friend of mine suggested Reese's Peanut Butter Cups and I would say that might be a close second. Even if you don't like Oreos you should give these a try. You can't really taste the Oreo factor. It's the taste of excellence in engineering.
<h3><strong>Future Work</strong></h3>
I'd like to incorporate Bacon into this at some point.
