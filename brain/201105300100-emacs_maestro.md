the mac world is a rotten mixed fruit bowl of lots of users; there are
the [textmate][tm] people who are hanging on to their editor in hopes
that a new release will be coming soon; then there is the camp of
textmate users migrating to [vim][vim] ([macvim][macvim]) because they
see modes as a way to pick up chicks; and in some dark corners of the
world there are people like me who switch from vim to [emacs][emacs]
([cocoa emacs][cocoaemacs]) because they finally figured out after 10
years of using one tool; life could be better; nothing is perfect --
things can only be better;

the bonus of using emacs on a mac is that there is already *partial*
support for emacs keybindings everywhere; it's partial because you
don't get the milk for free; commands like `control-a` take you to the
beginning of the sentence -- not the beginning of the line;
`control-e` takes you to the end of the sentence -- not the end of the
line; things are missing too such as `control-w` to erase the previous
word -- it isn't a default emacs shortcut but it is in the shell and
it is in my [emacs config][ec] and it should be default;

but there is help out in a world of fridgid deaths;

the bum solution is a program called [keyremap4macbook][kr4mb] and
it's pretty amazing -- despite a name that caused my eardrum to burst;
keyremap4macbook is actually more for vim users; there is builtin
configuration already for chording -- pressing more than one key at
once -- to change _modes_; this allows someone to hold -- say `s + d`
-- and use `hjkl` to navigate; just like your favorite editor and my
brain after listening to [young turks][yt] on repeat and being at the
office at 1am; unfortunately it doesn't come with extra configs to do
all the things i'd really like and its xml syntax leaves a bit to be
desired for easy configuration; don't get me wrong it's a great little
package and Takayama Fumihiko's mother should be proud.

the solution i'm convincing myself is the best right now is
[keyboard maestro][km];  i have been using the free trial for about
four hours now and i think i'm in plenty position to make a statement
that i am sold;  you can goto the website and check it out for
yourself;  the *key* benefit is that i can remap any keystroke to
another without having to write xml -- i can't believe i actually
believe at one point it was good!  oooo a list;

  - remap keys easy;  this means not only did i fix `control-a` and
    `control-e` but i also remapped `meta-f` to `forward-word` and
    `meta-b` to `backward-word`;  i think i am the most excited about
    this feature and i am going to write the least about it;
  - replace [textexpander][te]; i used te for a long while because the
    demo just seemed to keep working and only bugged me to click a
    button the first time i loaded the app after a reboot; but i
    didn't really have all that much use for it -- great for date/time
    stamps and mail signatures -- but the biggest grippe about te that
    i had was that it was such a simple concept that didn't execute
    consistently for me; i couldn't get it to expand snippets
    properly in emacs because it either wanted to paste -- `command`
    in cocoa emacs is rebound to `meta` for me -- or it wanted to do
    some fancy behind the scenes undressing of a text box widget and
    emacs laid it out; emacs laided it out -- is that how you pasted
    tense it?  emacs and the maestro get along; they drink martinis
    and laugh about their crappy golf scores;
  - i think for a list you're supposed to have three things and while
    there are probably a ton of other technical features that are
    great  -- because it's basically a global macro tool for your
    desktop -- i will just say the author seems down to earth;  and
    he's replied to all of my emails pretty much within the hour of
    when i sent it to him; i address these emails to him directly as
    "peter" and he gives an honest respond without making me feel
    like a jerk;

 the downside to keyboard maestro is that it won't please the vim live
 crew; the upshot to the maestro is that it's a macro buffet for you
 mac desktop.
