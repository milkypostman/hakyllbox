Do I continually out do myself or what???

### Ingredients

**The Crust**

* 2 cups all-purpose flour
* I teaspoon salt
* 1 tablespoon sugar
* 6 tablespoons butter
* 6 tablespoons shortening
* 6 to 8 tablespoons ice water


**The Rest**

* 1/2 cup unsalted butter
* 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
* 1/2 cup white sugar
* 1/2 cup packed brown sugar
* 1/4 cup water
* 6 apples - peeled, cored and sliced


### Instructions**

**The Crust**

1. Put the 2 cups flour, 1 tsp salt, and 1 Tbsp sugar in a big mixing bowl.
1. Use a masher (potato or dough) and mix in the 6 Tbsp butter, 6 Tbsp shortening, and 6-7 Tbsp water.
1. Mash this up until it holds together but isn't too goopy (7 Tbsp of water was good for me).
1. Wrap it in plastic wrap and put it in the fridge for 20 min.
1. Peel and cut the apples.
1. Tell someone how you wonder what your upstairs neighbour is doing.


**The Pie**

1. After 20 min, remove the pie crust from the fridge.
1. Take about 10-15% of the crust and set it aside.
1. Roll the big component of crust and put it in your pie thing.
1. Put all the apples on the pie crust. Mound them.
1. Take the 10-15% of pie crust you set aside and make it into long strings or flat slats that will go over the apples. Think old-school apple pie and how it looks when it has the Kris-Kross (daddy mack!) thing going on.

**The Sauce**

1. Melt the 1/2 cup butter
1. Add in the 3 Tbsp flour. Make it kinda a gel / goop.
1. Add 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar, and 1/4 cup water.
1. Get this boiling.
1. Pour it over the pie. Let it get good and covered.
1. Bake at 425 for 15 minutes.
1. Bake at 350 for 35-45 minutes. Use your eyes here.
1. Optional: sprinkle some cinnamon on top after you pull it out.
