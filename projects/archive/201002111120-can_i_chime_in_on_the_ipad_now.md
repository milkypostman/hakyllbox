There is a lot of media attention for the [iPad](http://apple.com/ipad/) that you can see just by [googling iPad](http://www.google.com/#q=ipad).  I just want to say that I am excited.  I am pushing Tara to get one.  Why?  BECAUSE IT'S PERFECT FOR HER.  I want my mother to get one too!

I have been using Windows 7 now (more on that in another post) and I have to admit, I don't trust it one bit.  I do trust Apple's approval process.  All the "bad" press about the App store has made me think, "OK, here is a company that is validating the software that I'm going to run on the computer."  This is great.  Why?  Because everyone and their brother is going to write software for this thing, so everything will be available and you'll know that people took the time to make it worth a damn because they knew they had to go through the process.  Let me see, software available for everything I need to do and it's good and I don't have to search around the internet a bunch to find it?  True, True, True.  Man, if windows software was as cheap and easy to find and not a total piece of crap when I bought it, that would be great for me.

I was just thinking last night and today how much I love my iPhone.  And I don't think of it like a phone.  I think of it as something that is a portable tool for me to use.  My dad carries a pocket knife around with him.  I carry an iPhone.  Mine may give me leg cancer though.

Why is everyone harping on Apple anyways?  People calling them "closed" and all this crap.  A [recent article by the WSJ](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703546004575055184080144688.html) suggested Apple is the next Microsoft.  Let me suggest one flaw in this argument: __Apple doesn't say that one technology is stupid (Java) then replace it by a proprietary one (C#).__ The argument here being Flash which if you ask anyone who develops for flash, it's a travesty.  Ridding the world of flash and pushing Javascript and HTML5 helps Linux users, helps WIndows, and yes, helps Mac users too.  And I'm not saying Javascript is better or HTML5 is the savior but it's at least doing something different.  Flash has not been going anywhere.  I agree with Steve Jobs: Adobe is Lazy.
