I have found two notes today. The first was on my car windshield.  I think I may submit this to passive-aggressive notes

<blockquote>Everybody and there mom parks on that curb in the alley so whoever has a problem with the black truck that parks there please text 630-xxx-xxxx or leave a message with at 101B with your apt number before you do anything absurd.</blockquote>

I am not mad about the note, it's just weird... First, this note looks handmade, and almost every car had one, so I can only assume someone wrote out like 25 notes by hand. Second, they spelled 'their' as 'there' which is a common mistake, probably brought on by anger. Last, I don't know what 'alley' they're talking about. I think they may mean the part in our parking lot where people are not supposed to park but do and make it hard for everyone else to get their car out of their spots. I will say that I do hate people that park their vehicles there.  I think that this guy is wrong but to be fair, i think everyone else who parks there is wrong, even those peoples' mothers!  I am going to investigate further (ie. go talk to the guy).  Hopefully I can convince him that while it's convenient to park there, it is a pain for everyone else.  ESPECIALLY if it's a truck cause those things are HUGE and make it even harder to get out of your spot (that is really a spot).  <strong>MY</strong> mom would probably say something like, "if your friends all jumped off a bridge would you do it too?" If I was mad at her I'd say "YES!!!" But in reality we know that's a rhetorical question and the answer is no.

As an added bonus is this note. Double Sided! All I'll say here is that someone was buying bacon. They also wrote floor cleaner twice! Which leads me to believe that they are covering up a murder.
